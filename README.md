## Project Description

This capstone project is an interactive ePortfolio built with Jekyll and a custom sidebar, demonstrating skills across fullstack software design, algorithms, and database management. It includes a home page with sections including my professional self-assessment, code review, and artifact enhancements.

The artifacts selected for all three enhancements originate from my Inventory Application developed in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. The app as a whole acts as an inventory management solution that allows users to create, update, and track item quantities, and optionally receive SMS alerts for when items are out-of-stock.

## Acknowledgements
Firstly, a huge thank you to my CS 499 professor, Mr. Satish Penmatsa. I express my deepest gratitude for your thoughtful feedback on assignments and ultimately helping me reach the finish line. Great professors stick with us for a lifetime.

<i>And where would I be if I didn't extend my thanks to Cannoli the Cat, also known by the names of many other Italian foods depending on mood and time of day, without whose ability to bundle his fluffiness into an even smaller bundle of fluffiness, none of this would be possible. We made it to the end, Linguini!</i>
